# Heart Failure Prediction Uisng CNN & ANN
In this project, we evaluate the prediction of heart failure using two different neural network models trained on a dataset from an open source. The models used are Artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks which are evaluated using the training and testing data. The outcomes of this project demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in predicting heart failure using clinical and demographic data. It is observed that the CNN Model tends to perform better than the ANN model hence accuarte for solving the classification problem.

# Usage 
The Code can be executed using Google Collab or Jupyter Notebook with appropriate paths to the input folders

# Data
This dataset has been taken from an open-source Kaggle. A total of 1200 observations were produced by combining several easily accessible databases.
