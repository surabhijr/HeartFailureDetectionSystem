# Heart Failure Prediction CNN & ANN
In this project, we evaluate the prediction of heart failure using two different neural network models trained on a dataset from an open source. The models used are Artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks which are evaluated using the training and testing data. The outcomes of this project demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in predicting heart failure using clinical and demographic data. It is observed that CNN Model tends to perform better than ANN model hence accuarte for solving the classification problem.
